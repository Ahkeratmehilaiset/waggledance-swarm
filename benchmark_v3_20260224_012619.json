      "correct_answer": "Yes. A colony with 6+ frames of brood and active laying in late May is strong enough for a honey super. Adding space prevents swarming impulse.",
      "response": "Based on your observation that there are already six frames with capped brood (indicating active bee population) plus two additional filled frames containing nectar or pollen reserves from previous seasons' stores; assuming these resources will sustain them through winter without needing immediate supplementation, you can wait until late June to early July. By then the colony should have consumed its stored honey and be actively foraging in earnest.\n\nHowever, if your region experiences an unusually warm spring causing bees to deplete their food reserves faster than expected or you're anticipating a colder autumn/winter season that could necessitate additional feeding (to maintain approximately 60-80% of hive weight as bee bread), you might want to install the honey super earlier. This would provide them with extra space for nectar collection and storage, potentially increasing your harvest by up to an estimated 20%.\n\nRemember also not just consider their current food reserves but take into account other factors such as weather conditions (average daily temperature above freezing is a good sign), presence of pests/diseases in the hive. If you notice any signs indicating that they are under stress or if there has been unusually cold snap, it would be wise to provide them with additional feeding sooner rather than later.\n\nIn conclusion: wait until late June/early July unless conditions suggest otherwise (e.g., colder autumn/winter forecast).",

Worker bees hatch in approximately 21-24 days, while drones emerge after about 16 days post-hatching from eggs laid on worker cells.\n\n\nNurse bee larvae develop for roughly 12 to 14 days before emerging and beginning their duties within the hive; this includes feeding broods with royal jelly initially followed by a diet of pollen and nectar. Drones are typically fed exclusively pollen until they emerge as full-grown bees, ready for mating flights which can occur after about two weeks post-emergence.\n\n\nWorker bee development is temperature-dependent: at 16°C (61°F), it takes around three days to develop from egg stage through the first instar larva; however, this process accelerates with increasing temperatures. Optimal brood rearing occurs between approximately 18-32°C (64-90°F). Queen bees can lay eggs continuously for up to several weeks under favorable conditions.\n\n\nPractical recommendations include maintaining hive temperature within an optimal range using heaters or ventilation fans during colder months and ensuring adequate food supply, as well as monitoring bee health regularly.",
